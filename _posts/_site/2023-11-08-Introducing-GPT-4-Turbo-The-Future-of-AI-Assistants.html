<h3 id="gpt-4-turbo-unleashing-powerful-capabilities">GPT-4 Turbo: Unleashing Powerful Capabilities</h3>

<p>GPT-4 Turbo is OpenAI’s latest model, designed to enhance the AI experience with its remarkable features. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extended Context Length</strong>: GPT-4 Turbo supports up to 128,000 tokens of context, which is 16 times longer than its predecessor. With the ability to handle extensive context, the model provides more accurate responses and a richer understanding of user inputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enhanced Control</strong>: OpenAI understands the importance of giving developers greater control over AI model responses. To address this, GPT-4 Turbo introduces JSON mode, ensuring valid JSON responses. It also excels in function calling, allowing multiple functions to be executed simultaneously, and follows instructions more effectively. Additionally, a new feature called reproducible outputs provides a higher degree of control over the model’s behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Up-to-date World Knowledge</strong>: OpenAI acknowledges the limitation of outdated knowledge in previous models. GPT-4 Turbo incorporates retrieval capabilities, enabling users to access knowledge from external documents or databases. Furthermore, the knowledge cutoff has been extended, with GPT-4 Turbo offering information up to April 2023 and a commitment to keeping knowledge current.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Modalities</strong>: OpenAI is expanding the horizons of AI capabilities with the integration of vision and speech. GPT-4 Turbo can now process image inputs, generate captions, classifications, and analysis. This breakthrough opens doors to various applications, such as assisting visually impaired individuals with tasks like product identification. Moreover, OpenAI’s new text-to-speech model enables the generation of natural-sounding audio from text, making voice interactions more engaging and accessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customization</strong>: OpenAI recognizes the need for models tailored to specific domains or proprietary data. With the introduction of Custom Models, OpenAI researchers collaborate closely with companies to build customized models that cater to their unique use cases. While initially priced higher, Custom Models offer an opportunity to push the boundaries of AI capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Higher Rate Limits and Copyright Shield</strong>: OpenAI values its customers and strives to provide a seamless experience. To facilitate increased usage, the tokens per minute rate limits for established GPT-4 customers have been doubled. Additionally, OpenAI has implemented Copyright Shield, taking responsibility for legal claims related to copyright infringement faced by ChatGPT Enterprise and API users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Affordable Pricing</strong>: OpenAI is committed to making AI accessible to as many users as possible. GPT-4 Turbo is considerably cheaper than GPT-4, with prompt tokens priced at one cent per thousand and completion tokens priced at three cents per thousand. This reduction in pricing, combined with enhanced capabilities, makes GPT-4 Turbo a highly cost-effective choice.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="the-power-of-ai-assistants-introducing-gpts">The Power of AI Assistants: Introducing GPTs</h3>

<p>OpenAI envisions a future where AI assistants seamlessly assist users in a personalized and customizable manner. The foundation for this vision lies in GPTs, tailored versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes. GPTs allow users to build customized AI models with specific instructions, expanded knowledge, and actions. These models can be published for others to utilize.</p>

<p>Let’s explore a few examples to illustrate the potential of GPTs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Canva GPT</strong>: Canva has leveraged GPT technology to develop an AI model that enables users to design posters by simply describing their requirements in natural language. This integration streamlines the design process and provides users with initial options generated through Canva’s APIs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Zapier GPT</strong>: Zapier has created a GPT that facilitates actions across 6,000 applications, unlocking integration possibilities. This GPT enables users to interact with various applications and perform actions, enhancing productivity and workflow efficiency.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OpenAI is launching the GPT store, where users can list their GPT models, share their creations, and contribute to a vibrant ecosystem. Revenue sharing opportunities will be available for those who create popular and valuable GPTs.</p>

<h3 id="building-assistive-experiences-with-the-assistance-api">Building Assistive Experiences with the Assistance API</h3>

<p>OpenAI understands the complexity of building AI assistants and aims to simplify the process. The Assistance API is introduced to empower developers in creating assistive experiences within their own applications. The API offers the following features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Persistent Threads</strong>: Developers no longer need to manage conversation history. The API handles long conversation threads, allowing developers to focus on building engaging user experiences.</p>
