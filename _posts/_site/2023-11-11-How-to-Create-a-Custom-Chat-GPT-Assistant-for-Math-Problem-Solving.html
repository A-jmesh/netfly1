<h3 id="1-import-openai">1. Import OpenAI</h3>
<p>To get started, we need to import OpenAI, the powerful tool that will enable us to create our custom chat GPT assistant.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-up-the-client">2. Set Up the Client</h3>
<p>Next, we’ll set up the client using the OpenAI.OpenAI function. This will establish a connection with the OpenAI platform and allow us to access its features.</p>

<h3 id="3-create-the-assistant">3. Create the Assistant</h3>
<p>Now, it’s time to create our custom chat GPT assistant. We’ll use the client.beta.assistance.create function and provide a name for our tutor, such as “Math Tutor.” Additionally, we’ll include instructions like “You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions.” This will help the assistant understand its role and purpose.</p>

<h3 id="4-add-tools-and-define-the-model">4. Add Tools and Define the Model</h3>
<p>To ensure our assistant can run code and solve math problems effectively, we need to provide it with the necessary tools. This includes a code interpreter. Additionally, we’ll specify the model name as “GPT4 turbo” to leverage its advanced capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="5-initialize-the-assistant-create-a-thread-and-send-a-message">5. Initialize the Assistant, Create a Thread, and Send a Message</h3>
<p>With the assistant set up, we can now initialize it, create a thread for the conversation, and send a message. The message will contain the math problem we want to solve, such as “I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?” This simulates a student asking a question to the math tutor.</p>

<h3 id="6-run-the-code">6. Run the Code</h3>
<p>To initiate the solving process, we’ll use the client.beta.threads.runs.create function. This will run the code and provide the thread ID and assistant ID as parameters. We’ll also include an instruction to address the user as “Mervyn Preysen,” adding a personalized touch to the conversation.</p>

<h3 id="7-wait-for-completion">7. Wait for Completion</h3>
<p>After running the code, we need to wait for it to complete. We can do this by importing the time module and using the time.sleep function to pause the execution for a specific duration. In this case, we’ll wait for 10 seconds to allow the assistant enough time to solve the math problem.</p>

<h3 id="8-retrieve-and-analyze-the-messages">8. Retrieve and Analyze the Messages</h3>
<p>Once the run is complete, we’ll retrieve the status of the thread using the client.beta.threads.run.retrieve function. If the status is “completed,” we can proceed to retrieve all the messages exchanged between the tutor and the student. This will provide us with a comprehensive view of the conversation.</p>

<h3 id="9-print-the-conversation">9. Print the Conversation</h3>
<p>To analyze the conversation, we’ll loop through the messages and extract the role (student or assistant) and the content of each message. This will give us a clear understanding of how the math problem was solved and the interaction between the two parties.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully created your own custom chat GPT assistant for solving math problems. With this powerful tool at your disposal, you can now tackle complex equations with ease.
