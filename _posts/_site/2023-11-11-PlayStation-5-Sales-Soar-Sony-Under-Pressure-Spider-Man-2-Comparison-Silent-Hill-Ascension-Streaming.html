<p>According to recent data from Push Square, the PlayStation 5 console emerged as the best-selling platform in terms of both units purchased and dollar sales in the US during September 2023. This is despite the release of Starfield on rival hardware. The Xbox Series X and S secured the second spot, followed by the Nintendo Switch in third place. Surprisingly, Starfield became the best-selling game for September 2023, with Mortal Kombat 1 and EA Sports FC 24 taking second and third places, respectively. It’s important to note that the Circana charts are based on dollar sales, excluding Xbox Game Pass downloads from Starfield’s position. The PS5’s continued success without any major exclusives released in September showcases its unstoppable momentum in the market.</p>

<h2 id="sony-faces-pressure-for-major-acquisition">Sony Faces Pressure for Major Acquisition</h2>
<p>In response to Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, Sony is now under tremendous pressure to make a major acquisition of its own. Analysts, including Canton Games CEO Dr. Serkin Toto and Ampere Analysis Pierce Harding Rolls, believe that Sony will actively pursue mergers and acquisitions. Dr. Toto even mentions that Sony may seek a “large one” that would have a significant impact on the company. Hiroki Totoki, who will take over as interim CEO in March of next year, has expressed openness to consolidation. However, the choice of which publisher Sony might acquire and how they handle exclusivity remains uncertain. While further consolidation raises concerns, it’s understandable why Sony would want to respond to Microsoft’s move. Share your thoughts on this development in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Ahead of its global launch, a comparison video showcasing the visual modes of Spider-Man 2 on PS5 has been released. The highly anticipated sequel from Insomniac Games has garnered outstanding reviews, with praise for its visuals, performance, story, and traversal system. Spider-Man 2 offers two visual modes: a quality mode and a performance mode. The quality mode prioritizes resolution and visual fidelity, running the game at a dynamic 4K and 30 FPS. On the other hand, the performance mode operates at 1440p and 60 FPS, sacrificing certain graphical elements. Additionally, the game can run at 120 hertz, with a reduced rendering resolution in quality mode. The comparison video suggests that many players may prefer the performance mode due to its impressive visuals and higher frame rates. Which mode will you choose?</p>
