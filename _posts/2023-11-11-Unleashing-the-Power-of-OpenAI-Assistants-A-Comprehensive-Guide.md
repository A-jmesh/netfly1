Join us on this journey as we explore the possibilities and potential of this groundbreaking technology. Let's dive in and unlock the full potential of OpenAI assistants together!



## OpenAI Dev Day Conference: Exploring the New Feature of Assistants

Hey everybody, recently OpenAI hosted their Dev Day conference and introduced a range of exciting features. One of the highlights is the introduction of "assistants." In this blog article, we will delve into the concept of assistants, how they work, and why they are significant. So, let's dive in!

### Understanding the Terminologies and Methodologies of Assistants

Before we explore the technicalities of assistants, it's crucial to grasp some key terms associated with them. While we used to interact with chat GPT models using API endpoints and prompts, assistants have a different approach. As the name suggests, assistants enable OpenAI models to be called with specific instructions to tailor their personality and capabilities.

Additionally, assistants have the ability to access multiple tools concurrently. These tools can be OpenAI-hosted, such as code interpreters and knowledge retrievals, or custom-built third-party functions. This flexibility makes assistants a powerful tool in the AI landscape.

### The Building Blocks of Assistants: Threads, Messages, and Run Objects

To fully understand assistants, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the components that revolve around them. These components include threads, messages, and run objects.

- **Threads**: Threads represent a conversation session, similar to the chat GPT's web interface. Each conversation is stored as a thread, which contains all the messages exchanged between the user and the assistant.

- **Messages**: Messages are individual units of conversation. They exist independently from threads but need to be placed within a thread to maintain context and memory. When adding a new message to a thread, the thread must be run or rerun to incorporate the latest message.

- **Run Objects**: A run object is an invocation of an assistant or a thread. It is responsible for executing the conversation and progressing it through different lifecycle states. These states include queued, in progress, expired, completed, failed, or canceled.

By understanding the relationship between these building blocks, we can create more effective and contextually rich conversations with assistants.

### Building an Assistant: Step-by-Step Guide

Now that we have a solid grasp of the concept of assistants, let's explore how to build one. The following code snippets illustrate the process:

```python
# Import necessary packages
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Fetch OpenAI API key from .env file
load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create OpenAI client
openai.api_key = API_KEY

# Create a file for the assistant to reference
file = open("conversation.txt", "r")

# Define instructions for the assistant
assistant = openai.Assistant.create(
    name="Pharmacist Assistant",
    description="Helps customers with drug-related questions",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    tools=["code interpreter"],
    file=file,
)

# Create a thread and print its ID
thread = assistant.thread.create()
print("Thread ID:", thread.id)

# Create a run object with the thread ID and instructions
run = assistant.run.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    instructions="Look into the conversation.txt file attached and provide appropriate responses based on the customer's question.",
)

# Print the run ID
print("Run ID:", run.id)

# Prompt the user for a question
question = input("What's your question? ")

# Create a message and assign it to the thread
message = assistant.message.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="system",
    content=question,
)

# Create a new run block to execute the updated thread
new_run = assistant.run.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    instructions="",
)

# Wait for the run to complete
while new_run.status != "complete":
    new_run = assistant.run.retrieve(
        run_id=new_run.id,
    )

# Retrieve all the messages from the thread
messages = assistant.message.list(
    thread_id=thread.id,
)

# Print the assistant's responses
for message in messages:
    if message.role == "assistant":
        print("Assistant:", message.content)
```

By following the above steps, you can create a customized assistant that responds specifically to drug-related questions. The assistant is designed to fetch information from the provided `conversation.txt` file and provide appropriate responses based on the user's queries. It also has the capability to restrict conversations to the field of medicine, ensuring accurate and relevant information is provided.

### Interacting with the Assistant: A Closer Look

Once the assistant is set up and running, it's time to interact with it. The code snippet includes an infinite loop that prompts the user for questions. The assistant responds accordingly, providing tailored and informative answers. Here's an example interaction:

```
What's your question? 
User: I have a sore throat.
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you have a sore throat. To address the sore throat directly, we have the throat spray. It has anesthetic properties that can help relieve the pain. 

What's your question?
User: I'm feeling sleepless because of the throat.
Assistant: It's quite common to experience difficulty sleeping when you have a sore throat. In addition to the throat spray, you might consider using an over-the-counter sleep aid. 

What's your question?
User: How can I cure migraine?
Assistant: I apologize, but I don't have a viable prescription for you regarding the treatment of migraines.

What's your question?
User: Who is Iron Man?
Assistant: I apologize, but I only take drug-related questions.

What's your question?
User: I think I have the flu. Do you have any suggestions?
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well and suspect you might have the flu. It's important to rest and stay hydrated. You may consider taking over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms. However, if your condition worsens or persists, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional. 

```


The introduction of assistants by OpenAI opens up new possibilities for developing more scalable and contextually aware AI solutions. Assistants provide a unique approach to interacting with OpenAI models, allowing for personalized experiences and tailored responses. By leveraging assistants, developers can build AI-powered solutions that offer precise and reliable information in various domains.
