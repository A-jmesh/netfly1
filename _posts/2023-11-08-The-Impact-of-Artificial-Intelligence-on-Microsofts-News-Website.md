## Introduction ##

In recent times, Microsoft's news website, MSN.com, has become a platform for controversial headlines and false stories. From conspiracy theories about the Democratic Party orchestrating the COVID-19 surge to obituaries that disrespect late NBA players, MSN.com has faced scrutiny for the content it publishes. This shift can be attributed to Microsoft's decision to replace human editors with artificial intelligence (AI) for news curation. In this article, we will delve into the impact of AI on Microsoft's news website and the concerns it raises for society and upcoming elections.

## The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in News Curation ##

Microsoft's homepage, MSN.com, holds a significant position as one of the most visited news websites globally. Due to its default installation on Windows software, millions of people rely on it as their primary news source. Up until 2018, Microsoft employed over 800 journalists to curate news content for the site. However, in recent years, AI has taken over this responsibility, causing an upheaval in the quality and accuracy of the news presented.

Former contracted editor, Rin Pfeiffer, who worked at MSN.com for eight years, recalls the drastic changes brought about by the implementation of AI. In 2020, she and her colleagues received the shocking news that their positions were being replaced by AI automation. This move was justified by Microsoft as a step towards streamlining operations and increasing efficiency. Nevertheless, the ramifications of relying solely on AI for news curation have become apparent.

## Unintended Consequences: False Stories and Biased Content ##

As AI took over the role of editors, concerns arose about the accuracy and impartiality of the news featured on MSN.com. Recent instances include false claims of President Biden falling asleep during a moment of silence, obituaries disrespecting late NBA players, and misleading stories about a California politician resigning after attacks by Elon Musk. These articles originate from fringe right-wing sites, raising questions about the selection process and editorial oversight.

It is worrisome that content with potential political bias finds its way onto the homepage of a platform used by millions. This situation can have tangible consequences, influencing public opinion and potentially impacting elections. Ferris Cower, an MSN.com user, experienced a noticeable shift in the content presented on his homepage after a software update. As a trustworthy company, Microsoft's inclusion of biased articles surprised him and others who rely on the platform for unbiased news.

## The Need for Responsible AI Implementation ##

Rin Pfeiffer and other critics argue that Microsoft should exercise caution in utilizing AI for news curation. They emphasize the importance of human editors in determining the legitimacy and reliability of news sources. While AI can undoubtedly enhance efficiency, it must remain under the control of human oversight to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information presented.

The absence of transparency regarding the number of people responsible for Microsoft's news AI raises further concerns. Brynn Pfeiffer reveals that the editors on her team, who were hired through a subcontractor, were all laid off. This lack of human intervention leaves room for AI to perpetuate misinformation, potentially influencing public opinion on a massive scale.

## Safeguarding Journalism and the Future of News ##

Following an inquiry by The Guardian newspaper, Microsoft faced criticism for an AI-generated poll published alongside a news story about a deceased individual. The poll asked readers to speculate on the cause of death, highlighting the need for responsible AI implementation. Microsoft has since launched an investigation and discontinued the AI polling feature.

In 2021, Microsoft shifted to an algorithm-based system for story selection on MSN.com. While this change aims to address concerns, it also highlights the issue of people failing to fact-check and blindly accepting information presented to them. The prevalence of such behavior further emphasizes the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity, whether through human or AI involvement.

## Conclusion ##

The integration of artificial intelligence in news curation has sparked a debate surrounding the future of journalism and the responsibility of tech giants like Microsoft. The shift from human editors to AI automation on MSN.com has resulted in the dissemination of false information and biased content. As elections loom, the potential impact of AI-generated news on public opinion cannot be ignored.

Microsoft's move towards algorithm-based story selection is a step in the right direction, but it is crucial to strike a balance between efficiency and the need for human oversight. Transparency regarding AI's role and the inclusion of responsible journalistic practices are essential to safeguard the integrity of news and ensure informed decision-making by the public.

While AI undoubtedly offers opportunities for streamlining operations, it must be used responsibly to avoid the propagation of misinformation. The future of news lies in finding the right balance between human expertise and technological advancements. As consumers of news, it is our responsibility to question and fact-check information, relying on credible sources to shape our understanding of the world.### Conclusion
