Title: How to Use Stable Diffusion in Google Colab for Free: A Step-by-Step Guide

Meta-description: Learn how to use Stable Diffusion in Google Colab without the need for a high-end GPU or CPU. This comprehensive guide provides a step-by-step process to help you utilize Stable Diffusion and install desired models. Read on to discover how you can create stunning, high-quality images using this powerful tool.

## Introduction ##
Are you interested in using Stable Diffusion but don't have access to a high-end GPU or computer specs? Look no further! In this article, we'll show you how to use Stable Diffusion in Google Colab for free. We'll provide you with a Google Collab notebook that allows you to not only use Stable Diffusion but also install your desired models. So let's dive into the details and learn how to use Stable Diffusion without any further ado.

## Step-by-Step Guide ##
1. Set up Google Colab and Select T4 GPU
Using Google Colab, you can access Stable Diffusion for free. Start by going to the Runtime tab and selecting "Change Runtime." Ensure that you select the T4 GPU option instead of the default CPU. Once done, save your settings and click on the Connect button to establish a connection to your GPU.

2. Execute the Code
In the Google Colab notebook, navigate to the first cell and click on the "Run" button. This will execute the code necessary to run Stable Diffusion. Please note that this process may take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. So be patient and wait for the green check mark to appear on the first cell.

3. Explore Stable Diffusion Models
Before proceeding to the next step, click on the provided link in the notebook. This link will showcase all the available Stable Diffusion models that you can install within the Google Colab notebook. By default, the "Stable Diffusion Realistic version 5" will be selected. If you prefer a different version, you can easily switch by replacing the word "false" with "true" in the notebook. Feel free to explore the models and make your selection.

4. Install Desired Models
If you wish to install additional models from Civit AI, you have that option too. We'll guide you through this process later in the article. For now, simply close the models selection window and proceed to run the second cell. This step may also take a few minutes, and if you encounter any errors, don't worry as it's a normal part of the process. Just rerun the cell to continue.

5. Access the Invoke AI Link
Once the second step is completed, you'll notice the green check mark on the second cell. Now, run the third cell and wait for the Invoke AI link to appear. It's important not to open this link yet; instead, continue to the next step.

6. Explore the Invoke AI Interface
Click on the first link provided in the notebook to access the Invoke AI interface. Here, you'll find the super duper Stable Diffusion. The interface allows you to enter prompts, select the number of images, specify the number of steps, and view the list of installed models.

7. Install Your Desired Models
To install additional models, click on the "Model Manager" option and choose "Import Model." You'll need to paste the link of the desired model, which you can find on Civit AI's website. Once you've added the link, the model will be imported, and you can find it in the model section of the interface. This process may take some time, so be patient.

8. Generate Images
After installing your desired models, it's time to generate images. Enter a prompt in the interface, such as "a beautiful lady with freckles in a coffee shop" or "a bouquet hyper-realistic." Once you're ready, click on the "Invoke" button to generate the image. While the image is being generated, we invite you to join our WhatsApp channel, where we share the latest AI news and cool AI stuff. Find the link in the description below.

9. Upscale Your Images
If you'd like to upscale your image, simply click on the "Upscale" button in the interface. Choose your desired upscaling model, such as "real s10 4x plus," and click on the "Upscale Image" option. This will start the upscaling process.

10. Download Your Image
Once the upscaling process is complete, you can download your image by selecting it and choosing the "Download Image" option. Feel free to experiment with different seed values, the number of images, and the number of steps to enhance your creations further. Additionally, the interface offers a canvas option that we can't cover in this article due to time constraints.
