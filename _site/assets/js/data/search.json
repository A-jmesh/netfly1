So, let’s dive in!Understanding the Terminologies and Methodologies of AssistantsBefore we explore the technicalities of assistants, it’s crucial to grasp some key terms associated with them. While we used to interact with chat GPT models using API endpoints and prompts, assistants have a different approach. As the name suggests, assistants enable OpenAI models to be called with specific instructions to tailor their personality and capabilities.Additionally, assistants have the ability to access multiple tools concurrently. These tools can be OpenAI-hosted, such as code interpreters and knowledge retrievals, or custom-built third-party functions. This flexibility makes assistants a powerful tool in the AI landscape.The Building Blocks of Assistants: Threads, Messages, and Run ObjectsTo fully understand assistants, it’s important to familiarize ourselves with the components that revolve around them. These components include threads, messages, and run objects. Threads: Threads represent a conversation session, similar to the chat GPT’s web interface. Each conversation is stored as a thread, which contains all the messages exchanged between the user and the assistant. Messages: Messages are individual units of conversation. They exist independently from threads but need to be placed within a thread to maintain context and memory. When adding a new message to a thread, the thread must be run or rerun to incorporate the latest message. Run Objects: A run object is an invocation of an assistant or a thread. It is responsible for executing the conversation and progressing it through different lifecycle states. These states include queued, in progress, expired, completed, failed, or canceled. By understanding the relationship between these building blocks, we can create more effective and contextually rich conversations with assistants.Building an Assistant: Step-by-Step GuideNow that we have a solid grasp of the concept of assistants, let’s explore how to build one.
