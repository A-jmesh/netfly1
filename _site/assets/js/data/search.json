Whether you’re a student struggling with equations or a teacher looking for a new tool, this groundbreaking technology is here to revolutionize the way we learn. So, let’s dive in and discover how you can create your own math-solving assistant.Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Chat GPT Assistant1. Import OpenAITo get started, we need to import OpenAI, the powerful tool that will enable us to create our custom chat GPT assistant.2. Set Up the ClientNext, we’ll set up the client using the OpenAI.OpenAI function. This will establish a connection with the OpenAI platform and allow us to access its features.Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Chat GPT Assistant3. Create the AssistantNow, it’s time to create our custom chat GPT assistant. We’ll use the client.beta.assistance.create function and provide a name for our tutor, such as “Math Tutor.” Additionally, we’ll include instructions like “You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions.” This will help the assistant understand its role and purpose.4. Add Tools and Define the ModelTo ensure our assistant can run code and solve math problems effectively, we need to provide it with the necessary tools. This includes a code interpreter. Additionally, we’ll specify the model name as “GPT4 turbo” to leverage its advanced capabilities.5. Initialize the Assistant, Create a Thread, and Send a MessageWith the assistant set up, we can now initialize it, create a thread for the conversation, and send a message. The message will contain the math problem we want to solve, such as “I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?” This simulates a student asking a question to the math tutor.6. Run the CodeTo initiate the solving process, we’ll use the client.beta.threads.runs.create function. This will run the code and provide the thread ID and assistant ID as parameters. We’ll also include an instruction to address the user as “Mervyn Preysen,” adding a personalized touch to the conversation.7. Wait for CompletionAfter running the code, we need to wait for it to complete. We can do this by importing the time module and using the time.sleep function to pause the execution for a specific duration. In this case, we’ll wait for 10 seconds to allow the assistant enough time to solve the math problem.8. Retrieve and Analyze the MessagesOnce the run is complete, we’ll retrieve the status of the thread using the client.beta.threads.run.retrieve function. If the status is “completed,” we can proceed to retrieve all the messages exchanged between the tutor and the student. This will provide us with a comprehensive view of the conversation.9. Print the ConversationTo analyze the conversation, we’ll loop through the messages and extract the role (student or assistant) and the content of each message. This will give us a clear understanding of how the math problem was solved and the interaction between the two parties.Congratulations! You’ve successfully created your own custom chat GPT assistant for solving math problems. With this powerful tool at your disposal, you can now tackle complex equations with ease.

Let’s dive in!PlayStation 5 Sales Data Surprises AnalystsAccording to recent data from Push Square, the PlayStation 5 console emerged as the best-selling platform in terms of both units purchased and dollar sales in the US during September 2023. This is despite the release of Starfield on rival hardware. The Xbox Series X and S secured the second spot, followed by the Nintendo Switch in third place. Surprisingly, Starfield became the best-selling game for September 2023, with Mortal Kombat 1 and EA Sports FC 24 taking second and third places, respectively. It’s important to note that the Circana charts are based on dollar sales, excluding Xbox Game Pass downloads from Starfield’s position. The PS5’s continued success without any major exclusives released in September showcases its unstoppable momentum in the market.Sony and Zee takeover newsSony Faces Pressure for Major AcquisitionIn response to Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, Sony is now under tremendous pressure to make a major acquisition of its own. Analysts, including Canton Games CEO Dr. Serkin Toto and Ampere Analysis Pierce Harding Rolls, believe that Sony will actively pursue mergers and acquisitions. Dr. Toto even mentions that Sony may seek a “large one” that would have a significant impact on the company. Hiroki Totoki, who will take over as interim CEO in March of next year, has expressed openness to consolidation. However, the choice of which publisher Sony might acquire and how they handle exclusivity remains uncertain. While further consolidation raises concerns, it’s understandable why Sony would want to respond to Microsoft’s move.
